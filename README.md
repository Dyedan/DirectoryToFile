Ever needed to print the source code of a project or an assignment? your development environment didn't support such an archaic operation? This little tool was built for that exact reason!

Open up the Program.cs file, edit the Main() to fit your needs, and you're good to go!

Yeah, I know that's far from perfect, but it worked for me, and it can work for you!

I might improve this tool when I have some free time, but feel free to contribute!
